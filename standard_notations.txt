While each programs internally stores data in its own favorite format,
it is important that a standard format is established for exchanging
data related to the Subotto. It is then decided that:

 * Time is always expressed as a floating number indicating a number
   of seconds starting from the UNIX epoch.

 * Table coordinates are always expressed as floating numbers
   indicating a number of meters. The X axis is parallel to the long
   side of the table and pointing towards to blue goal. The Y axis is
   parallel to the short side of the table and pointing towards the
   blue players. The origin (0.0, 0.0) coincides with the geometrical
   centroid of the table.

 * Foosmen offset is always expressed as a floating point number
   indicating a number of meters. The offset coordinate increases when
   the rod is moved towards the blue players (independently of whether
   we are considering a red or blue rod). The offset origin 0.0
   coincides with the rod being in the midpoint of the positions it
   can assume.

 * Foosmen angle is always expressed as a floating point number
   indicating a number of radians. The angle coordinate increases when
   the rod is rotated so that the foot of the foosmen are moved
   towards the blue goal (independently of whether we are considering
   a red or blue rod). The angle origin 0.0 coincides with the rod
   being perfectly vertical.


When enumerating the rods of a single team (red or blue), then they
are numbered from 0 to 3 with the following meaning:
 * 0: goalkeeper;
 * 1: defence;
 * 2: midfield;
 * 3: attack.


When enumerating all of the rods, then they are numbered from 0 to 7
with the following meaning:
 * 0: red goalkeeper;
 * 1: red defence;
 * 2: blue attack;
 * 3: red midfield;
 * 4: blue midfield;
 * 5: red attack;
 * 6: blue defence;
 * 7: blue goalkeeper.


When using positional notation to qualify fields (for instance in a
CSV file) it is assumed that the order is as follows:

 *  0: timestamp;
 *  1: ball X;
 *  2: ball Y;
 *  3: red goalkeeper shift;
 *  4: red goalkeeper angle;
 *  5: red defence shift;
 *  6: red defence angle;
 *  7: red midfield shift;
 *  8: red midfield angle;
 *  9: red attack shift;
 * 10: red attack angle;
 * 11: blue goalkeeper shift;
 * 12: blue goalkeeper angle;
 * 13: blue defence shift;
 * 14: blue defence angle;
 * 15: blue midfield shift;
 * 16: blue midfield angle;
 * 17: blue attack shift;
 * 18: blue attack angle.
